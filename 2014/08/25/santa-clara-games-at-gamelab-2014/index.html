We were happy to get to gamelab, we didn't know there was a 2 hours
waiting line to enter :(</p>
<p>On June 25 we assisted to Barcelona to
<a href="http://gamelab.es/2014/">Gamelab</a>. We had three intense days of
conferences, networking and conversations with friends and other indie
developers from Spain. And, as you will see by the pictures, we
had chance to talk about <strong><em>HassleHeart</em></strong> with everybody ;)</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="mr_yoshida.jpg" />
First day, first encounter, Mr. Shuhei Yoshida. Great start!</p>
<p>We met Mr. <strong>Shuhei Yoshida</strong>(<a href="http://twitter.com/yosp">@yosp</a>)
(<span style="color: #545454;">President of Sony's Worldwide
Studios</span>) and chat about indie developers like us and the
possibility to bring <strong><em>HassleHeart</em></strong> to <strong>PSVita</strong> (fingers crossed!).</p>
<p>Mr. <strong>Keiji Inafune</strong> got his own copy of the game too and he seemed to
like the idea of a robot tearing apart humans hearts (maybe we gave him
ideas for <strong><em>Mighty N.9</em></strong>, who knows...).</p>

<p><em>Tim Schafer's panel <a href="http://vimeo.com/99904165">Dreams, machines and
inspiration</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/gamelab">Gamelab
Conference</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</em><br>
We have to apologize with<strong>Tim Schafer</strong>
<span style="color: #545454;"><a href="http://twitter.com/TimOfLegend">@TimOfLegend</a> whom
we boarded after his panel (if you read this, sorry Tim, we hope you
will like the game) in order to give him a copy of the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #545454;">We also met the adorable and
kind</span> <strong>Kim
Swift</strong> (<span style="color: #545454;"><a href="http://twitter.com/K2theSwift">@K2theSwift</a>) from
Amazon Games Studio and had the opportunity to c</span>hat with
<strong>Richard
Lemarchand</strong> (<span style="color: #545454;"><a href="http://twiiter.com/rich_lem">@rich_lem</a>) who
as very nice with us.</span></p>

We met Keiji Inafune just before his panel and gave him a HassleHeart
copy</p>
<p>They all got their own <strong><em>HassleHeart</em></strong> copy with a bonus track, a copy
of <strong><em>Return to Castle Urgull</em></strong>as well!</p>
<p>We specially enjoyed <strong>Neil McFarland</strong>'s
<a href="https://twitter.com/parishair">@parishair</a> panel from <strong>UsTwo Games</strong>
about <strong><em>Monument Valley</em></strong>'s development. Their vision about
development is similar than ours, and we liked the way they focus on
bringing a good experience to the gamers and be honest with them.</p>

Rami was super kind and shared with us some tricks about indie
development</p>
<p>On the second day we had the pleasure of lunch with <strong>Rami
Ismail</strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/tha_rami">@tha_rami</a>) from
<strong>Vlambeer</strong>share ideas and concerns about indie development. He is an
awesome and great guy.</p>

<p>We feel so sorry we couldn't stay to Rami's inspiring panel, but we ran
late to take the airplane back home :,(. Next time, we will try to have
more light schedule.</p>

Sharing some beers with MakPollo and Solans at Marsella (where Woody
Allen's Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona film was shot)</p>
<p>Truth is it's been and incredible experience. People in this industry
was very close, friendly and excited about sharing knowledge and
experiences. We have learn a lot, powered up our batteries and we are
looking forward to make amazing games and show them to everybody next
year at Gamelab 2015 !</p>
