                <p>The Global Game Jam in Donostia concluded last night (Jan 26th). It was
an awesome event. We had 25 participants, both amateurs to
professionals, and a total of 9 games were born over the weekend on our
location! <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org/2014/games?title=&amp;country=ES&amp;city=donostia&amp;tools=All&amp;diversifier=All&amp;platforms=All" title="Games created at Donostia Global Game Jam">You can check them all out on the Global Game Jame
website</a>.</p>

Donostia GGJ2014 Jammers and Organizers</p>
<p>Here at Santa Clara Games, we love to make games, but we wondered if we
would have have enough time to develop one while organizing this event.
Early Saturday morning, close to 1.30am, I saw Iñaki drafting up some
concepts on his notebook, and I said, "Hey buddy, things seem to be
quiet, and people are very focused on their jobs. Shall we design
something around the GGJ theme?", and he said "YES! In fact I'm playing
with some ideas right now".</p>
<p>After a short brainstorm we created "<a href="/labs/alone-forest-ggj14/" title="Alone in the Forest">Alone in the
Forest</a>",
an old-school exploration game. The game’s mechanics deal with the
player’s concepts of videogames and explores how different kinds of
players, seeing the same things, interpret them in their own way. The
player’s goal is to find the chest full of gold hidden inside an ancient
castle. We used
<a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net" title="Puzzlescript">PuzzleScript</a> to develop
our ideas. This is a fantastic tool for quick prototyping!</p>

site, or feel free to use the <a href="https://github.com/Legrandk/ggj14" title="Alone in the Forest (Github)">"Fork" on
GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>On sunday at 9:00am, we had finished uploading the game to the GGJ
servers and had completed all the game's sheet information. Then, I
realized that there were still 10 hours left until the event closed! If
I wanted to keep myself awake until then, I had to start on something
ASAP. I asked myself if I would be able to create a simple version of
Portal game using
<a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net" title="PuzzleScript">Puzzlescript</a>. With a few
concept proofs that I made in 10 minutes, I decided to chase down the
team and convinced them to help me make another new game using Portal's
mechanics. It sounded crazy! But they loved the idea of developing a
second new game in such short period of time!</p>
<p>The result was "<a href="/labs/simple_portal-gg14/simple_portal.html" title="Simple Portal - Take your Cake!">Simple Portal - Take your Cake</a>". It's
a puzzle-based game in which the player must take the Cake using
portal's mechanics.</p>

<p>That's all folks! We hope you enjoy the games, and we're looking forward
to organizing the next Donostia Global Game Jam 2015!</p>
